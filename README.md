# Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard that allows a user to look up the weather forecast for multiple cities. Using the OpenWeather API, the dashboard
features current weather conditions, as well as the 5-day forecast for the selected location. This weather dashboard app resembles the mock-up functionality provided by the client
and includes all features as requested in the user story.

## User Story 

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
